<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The program <B>srcml2src</B> translates from the XML  source-code  representa-
       tion  srcML  into source code. The srcML format allows for XML address-
       ing, querying, and transformation of source code. The srcML format  for
       a source-code file is typically produced by <B>src2srcml</B>.

       The  combination  of <B>src2srcml</B> and <B>srcml2src</B> allows for full round-trip
       transformation of source-code files without any loss of comments, white
       space, and preprocessing statements.

       Conversion from the srcML format to source code is relatively straight-
       forward. All XML tags are removed and escaped characters are unescaped.
       Special srcML elements for characters not permitted in XML, e.g., form-
       feed, are converted back to their original characters.

       In addition to conversion, <B>srcml2src</B> provides various  srcML  utilities
       such as extracting metadata, extracting individual files in a srcML ar-
       chive (as either text or XML), and extracting metadata from  individual
       files in a srcML archive.  It can also be used to extract all the indi-
       vidual files in a srcML archive.

       Further, <B>srcml2src</B> allows for querying srcML  using  XPath  expressions
       and  RelaxNG,  and  transformation  using XLST. With a srcML archive, a
       query/transformation is applied individually to each file and  the  re-
       sults  combined.  This allows the XPath, XSLT, or RelaxNG to work effi-
       ciently on large srcML documents that contain all of the source code in
       a large project.

       Using the character - in the place of an input srcML file filename uses
       standard input, and in place of an output source-code file  uses  stan-
       dard output.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-h,</B> <B>--help</B>
              Output the help and exit.

       <B>-V,</B> <B>--version</B>
              Output the version of srcml2src and exit.

       <B>-t,</B> <B>--src-encoding=</B><I>encoding</I>
              Sets  the encoding used for the output text source-code files to
              <I>encoding</I>. The default is ISO-8859-1.

       <B>-U,</B> <B>--unit=</B><I>number</I>
              Refers to a specific file in a  srcML  archive.   The  numbering
              starts  at  1.  If  the number is outside of the range of nested
              on the output element "unit" are the attributes of the individu-
              al unit with any missing attributes taken from the root unit.

       <B>-z,</B> <B>--compress</B>
              Output is in compressed gzip format.

       <B>--no-xml-declaration</B>
              No output of the default XML declaration for XML output options.
              Useful when the output is to be placed inside another XML  docu-
              ment.

       <B>--no-namespace-decl</B>
              No  output  of  namespace  declarations  for XML output options.
              Useful when the output is to be placed inside another XML  docu-
              ment.

       <B>-v,</B> <B>--verbose</B>
              Verbose output to standard error.


</PRE>
<H2>METADATA OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       Options  to access to the metadata stored in the srcML document. Unless
       otherwise noted, the metadata is quickly extracted from the start  root
       element  or  the XML declaration and does not traverse the entire docu-
       ment. Output is to standard output.

       <B>-l,</B> <B>--language</B>
              Output the language of the srcML file as stored in the attribute
              "language"  in the element "unit".  The language is the value of
              the attribute of the root element, or for a particular  unit  if
              specified with the <B>--unit</B> option.

       <B>-d,</B> <B>--directory</B>
              Output  the  directory  of  the  srcML file as stored in the at-
              tribute "dir" in the element "unit". The directory is the  value
              of  the  attribute of the root element, or for a particular unit
              if specified with the <B>--unit</B> option.

       <B>-f,</B> <B>--filename</B>
              Output the filename of the srcML file as stored in the attribute
              "filename"  in the element "unit".  The filename is the value of
              the attribute of the root element, or for a particular  unit  if
              specified with the <B>--unit</B> option.

       <B>-s,</B> <B>--src-version</B>
              Output  the  version of the srcML file as stored attribute "ver-
              sion" in the element "unit". The version is the value of the at-
              tribute  of the root element, or for a particular unit if speci-
              fied with the <B>--unit</B> option.

       <B>-p,</B> <B>--prefix=</B><I>uri</I>
              Output the prefix of the namespace given by uri. The name of the
              prefix is output with a newline character. The default namespace
              information is that same as that of  the  full  flag  option  to
              src2srcml to form it, without the leading "--".

       <B>-L,</B> <B>--longinfo</B>
              Output the metadata of the <B>--info</B> option along with the count of
              the nested files in a srcML archive. Requires traversal  of  the
              entire srcML document.


</PRE>
<H2>QUERYING AND TRANSFORMATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       Options  for efficiently querying and transformation srcML.  Standalone
       XML tools that are DOM based (XPath, XSLT) have large  memory  require-
       ments  with  large  srcML files. The <B>srcml2src</B> options work efficiently
       with large srcML archives that contain large  numbers  of  files  in  a
       project,  e.g.,  tens of thousands of files for a project in a single 1
       GB srcML archive 1 GB.  All queries/transformations are performed on  a
       unit by unit basis inside the srcML archive.

       <B>--xpath=</B><I>xpath</I>
              Apply  the XPath expression <I>xpath</I> to each individual unit in the
              srcML archive and combine the results of the individual queries.

              To refer to elements standard srcML prefixes (see <B>srcml2src</B>) are
              used.  One exception is that prefix "src" is used for srcML ele-
              ments,  e.g.,  "src:unit".  Note that these prefixes do not have
              to match the prefixes used in the document.

              If the result of the expression is anything other then a set  of
              nodes  the individual unit results are combined. For numeric re-
              sults, e.g., counts, the final result is the sum of the individ-
              ual  results. For boolean values, the result is the logical "or"
              of the individual results.

              The output is a srcML archive with each XPath expression  result
              in  its  own  individual element "unit". If the XPath expression
              does not result in a element "unit", one is wrapped  around  the
              result.  This  format allows for pipelines of queries and trans-
              formations.

       <B>--xslt=</B><I>xslt</I><B>_</B><I>file</I>
              Apply the XSLT program <I>xslt</I><B>_</B><I>file</I> to each individual  unit  in  a
              srcML  archive  and combine the results of the individual trans-
              formations.

              The XSLT program can use any part of XSLT 1.0,  and  many  EXSLT
              extension functions.  Since the XSLT program doesn't have access
              to some information on the entire archive, the program is passed
              a  series  of  internally  generated  parameters. The parameters
              src:filename, src:directory, src:version, and  src:language  are
              the corresponding entries from the root element "unit".  The pa-
              rameter src:position is the position of an  individual  unit  in
              the  root unit, e.g., the position of the file in the entire sr-
              cML archive. Parameters can also be passed to the  XSLT  program

       <B>--relaxng=</B><I>relaxng</I><B>_</B><I>file</I>
              Apply  the  RelaxNG grammar <I>relaxng</I><B>_</B><I>file</I> to each individual unit
              in the srcML archive and combine the parts that match.

              The RelaxNG grammar  acts  as  a  filter  for  individual  units
              (files).  If  the RelaxNG grammar is valid for a unit, then that
              unit is output. The result is a  srcML  archive  with  only  the
              files that are valid based on the given RelaxNG grammar.
